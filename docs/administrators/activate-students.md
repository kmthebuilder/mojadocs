# Create and Activate Student Accounts

---

In order to use the Moja application, students must first have an account.

To create an account for a student, follow the steps outlined below. 

## Access the *Site Administration* Page

In order to create a student account, you must access the site administration page.  
This is where all work concerning administrative actions takes place.

!!! warning "Check Your Permissions!"

    If you don't have the proper administrative permission set, you will be unable to create users!  
    If you believe you should have these permissions and do not, **contact your Moja representative** for assistance!

## Navigate To the *Add a New User* Pane

Following the images below, first select the Users pane from the list of administrative areas.

Proceed through the fields, adding the user's information until you reach the end of the form.
